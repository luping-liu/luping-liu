## Hi there üëã

I am Luping Liu (ÂàòË∑ØÂπ≥). I am a second year Master's student in Computer Science from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), supervised by [Pro. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborates with [Yi Ren](https://github.com/RayeRen) (Sea AI Lab), [Chongxuan Li](https://zhenxuan00.github.io/) (Renmin University of China) closely. Prior to that, I just obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics from Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Pro. Feng Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0014136). For now, I focus on the acceleration and application of diffusion models, security and generalization of AI. My ultimate goal is to build general artificial intelligence to free people from repetitive and tedious work. 

### üî• News

- *2022.10*: üéâüéâ I win the 2022 national scholarship.
- *2022.05*: My PNDM is used as the default acceleration sampling method for [stable-diffusion ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CompVis/stable-diffusion?style=social)](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion).
- *2022.02*: I release the official implementation for PNDM (ICLR 2022).
